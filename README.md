## Introduction

This repository provides the `islandora/imagemagick` image which only exists
to provide a custom Alpine APK package(s).

Since this does not change often and takes a very long time to cross compile for
both platforms it's been moved to it's own repository.

## Requirements

To build the Docker images using the provided Gradle build scripts requires:

- [Docker 20+](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Host-platform Builds

You can build your host platform locally using the default builder like so.

```bash
docker context use default
docker buildx bake
```

## Multi-platform builds

To test multi-arch builds and remote build caching requires setting up a local
registry.

Please use [isle-builder] to create a builder to simplify this process. Using
the defaults provided, .e.g:

```
make start
```

After which you should be able to build with the following command:

```bash
REPOSITORY=islandora.io docker buildx bake --builder isle-builder ci --push
```
